Hearts of Iron IV: The Great War
--------------------------------


HOW TO INSTALL
==============

The folder that stores mods for the game is:

   - Windows: ...\Documents\Paradox Interactive\Hearts of Iron IV\mod\

   - Linux: ~/.paradoxinteractive/Hearts of Iron IV/mod/ or ~/.local/share/Paradox Interactive/Hearts of Iron IV/mod/

   - Mac: ~/Documents/Paradox Interactive/Hearts of Iron IV/mod/


Manually downloaded mods should include a .mod text file along with a folder. If so, the files can simply be dropped into the mod file. If one is downloading a newer version of a mod they already have installed, one should remove the older files first.
