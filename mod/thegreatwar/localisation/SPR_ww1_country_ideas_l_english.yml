 SPR_ww1_idea_generacion98:0 "Former Empire"
 SPR_ww1_idea_generacion98_desc:0 "Though once the world's foremost empire, a resounding defeat in the Spanish-American War and a sale of the Spanish Pacific to Germany has reduced the Empire to a few minor outposts in Africa, which has made the country nothing more than a regional power.

 SPR_ww1_idea_quintas_desc:0 "Corruption is rife in the Spanish military, which isn't exactly a well kept secret.

 SPR_ww1_idea_tiempos:0 "The Spanish Tragedy"
 SPR_ww1_idea_tiempos_desc:0 "Military defeats, rebellion, civil strife, instability, economic depression, and a spiteful, polarized electorate have defined Spain in recent memory.

 SPR_ww1_idea_caciquismo:0 "Caciquismo"
 SPR_ww1_idea_caciquismo_desc:0 "A corrupt group of political bosses are effectively responsible for regional rule and the ''democratic'' system in Spain.
