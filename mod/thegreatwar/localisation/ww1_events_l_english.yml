 ww1_spr.1.t:0 "The Situation in Spain"
 ww1_spr.1.d:0 "Since the end of the Spanish-American war, Spain has been on the decline. The Spanish King, Alfonso XII, is the head of an intensely unpopular government. His regime is known for its ludicrous corruption, from the Turno system (in which parties literally take turns in power, subverting the Democratic process) to powerful political bosses that ''politely'' let everyone know who to vote for. Worse yet, labor relations have been horrid since La Semana Tragica, the Tragic Week, during which protestors, mostly union-affiliated, were cut down in the streets by overeager members of the Guardia Civil. \n\nBefore any ambition of a restored empire comes to fruition, we must stabilize our nation."
